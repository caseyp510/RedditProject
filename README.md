#### RedditProject
For project 3, the goal is two-fold:

1.) Using Pushshift's API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.
2.) You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.

#### Problem Scenario

As an intern Data Scientist for Reddit, my first task is to help make creative suggestions to one of the largest subreddits on Reddit, r/gaming. r/gaming is currently at 3,100,154 members and it’s getting kinda wild in here. Some members want to discuss Pokemon, while others want to discuss NBA 2k. Other members want to discuss Fortnite, Overwatch, or Minecraft. Some members are just downright rude, leaving comments on posts of games they don’t like and creating chaos among the group. Let’s help calm things down. It could be helpful if we could create a system that could suggest other smaller or more specific forums to r/gaming members based on the language that they are currently using in the forum. As a smaller part of a bigger issue, let’s start by testing a model on two of our top gaming communities on Reddit, r/Fortnite (400k members) and r/Minecraft (2.5m members). Once we are able to determine that our model can most accurately distinguish between the two I’ll consult my boss and we can figure out the next steps to suggestions.
